Relations:

Todo: 
- Add specific structural constraints?
- Figure out details necessary for more definitive answers
    - Does every Course need at least one User? Or can a Course not participate in takes relationship?
        - Presumably we would populate all the courses before getting any users, so they wouldn't need any.
    - Same question as above for User for the same relationship
        - Presumably a User is able to not have any courses taken (in the current semester).
        - Regardless, how is a User's courses that they are taking populated? Is it self-reported?
        - Are Professors considered as taking the courses they are teaching?


User takes a Course
    Many to Many relationship
    Partial participation for both entities?

User posts Rating
    One to Many relationship between User and Rating
    Participation of User in the relationship is partial
    Participation of Rating in the relationship is total

User creates a Resource
    One to Many relationship between User and Resource
        But maybe we would want to allow collaborative resources?
            If so, this would be Many to Many
    Participation of User is partial
    Participation of Resource is total

Professor verifies Note
    One to Many relationship between Professor and Note
    Participation of Professor is partial
    Participation of Note is partial

Note contains Rating
    One to Many relationship between Note and Rating
    Participation of Note is partial
    Participation of Rating is total

Resource corresponds to a Course
    Many to One relationship between Resource and Course
    Participation of Resource is total
    Participation of Course is partial
